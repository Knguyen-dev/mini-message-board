# Mini Message Board

- A simple message board app in express.

<% your_code_here %>; when running code
<%= locals.someValue %>; when outputting a single value. This escapes special characters, resulting in a string value, rather than raw html.

<%- include(your_file_path) %>; when including a partial. Now this style doesn't escape html characters, allowing us to output raw html.
